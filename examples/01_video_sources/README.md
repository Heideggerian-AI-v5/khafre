The examples in this folder are showing various ways to obtain input data for Khafre:

* video from file
* video from a web socket, e.g. from the camera of a robot
* video from a simulation environment. Currently, we only have a wrapper for Sapien.

The examples are minimal -- not much happens apart from reading the video source and publishing the incoming images to a debug window. The examples do show however the basic patterns of setting up khafre bricks, connecting them, starting and stopping them.
